# Udacity-Data-Science-Capstone

### Overview

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for image recognition since the 80s. With the rapid increase in processing power, they now offer a great solution for an task requiring visual identification.

This project will attempt to use CNNs to identify dog breeds from unseen images. The aim will be to produce a function for users to feed in images and return a predicted dog breed, including methods to handle the inclusion of human faces.

### Contents

1. dog-app.ipynb
- notebook provided by udacity, where algorthims & models for dog breed detection are developed
2. saved-models
- directory containing saved tensorflow CNN models
3. test_images
- directory containing dog/ human images for testing


### Intructions for use

Designed for use in Udacity Dog Breed Workspace, as this is required to access training data. Instructions for use:

1. Place dog-app.ipynb in dog-project folder
2. Place test images in dog-project/images folder
3. Place saved-models in dog-project folder
